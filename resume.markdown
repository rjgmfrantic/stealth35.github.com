Résumé
======

![me][7]


I'm a web passionate, PHP, JavaScript and ActionScript developer, [Ruby on Rails][1] fan and a [GitHub][2] addict.

I love to spending time contributing to Open Source projects like [Symfony2][3] (one of the Top [contributors][4]), and [Zend Framework][5]. Also I like supporting my developers friends projects around the world.

Constantly improving my skills, I'm fond of learning new tricks but even more to teach and exchange about them between others passionates.

Working for the four years in a 'grand ecole', I have used the learning management system [Moodle][6], and produced some Movies.


Everyday tools
--------------

Mac, SublimeText, Github, Basecamp, Brain and Fun
